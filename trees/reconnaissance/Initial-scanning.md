# Initial scanning

Research network architecture, defence mechanisms, operating systems and applications. Find where the company resources are logically located. Once the IP addresses are known, probe and scan the network for vulnerable hosts, applications, or infrastructure equipment.

* Use a ping sweep to find what hosts are currently live on the network.
* Probe by looking for open ports on the available host computers to discover services.
* Most common applications use well-defined port numbers. Use the open port information further to discover the OS and the application servicing the port.
* Know, learn or research the vulnerabilities of OSs and the applications they run.
* Make a map of the hosts, servers, and weaknesses to exploit in the future. Keep adding to the map as more is discovered later in the process.
