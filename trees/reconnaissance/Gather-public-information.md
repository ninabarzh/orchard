# Gather public information

Gather as much information as possible on the target by using public sources.

* Use Search engines to understand what sensitive design and configuration information of the application/system/organisation is exposed both directly (on the organization's website) or indirectly (on a third party website): 
  * Network diagrams and configurations
  * Archived posts and emails by administrators and other key staff
  * Log on procedures and username formats
  * Usernames and passwords
  * Error message content
  * Development, test, UAT and staging versions of the website
* Learn more about the organisation and people on finder sites and check public records
* Domain Naming Systems (DNS) is another publicly available system that can provide a wealth of information regarding the IP addressing and naming strategies of virtually any organisation or company connected to the Internet. 

## Tools

* Google
* Duckduckgo
* Ixquick (Startpage)
* Binsearch
* Shodan
* [Check user names](https://checkusernames.com/)
* [PeekYou](https://www.peekyou.com/)
* [Lullar](https://lullar-com-3.appspot.com/)
* [Peoplesearch.net: Europe Free Public Records](https://publicrecords.searchsystems.net/Other_Nations/Europe_Free_Public_Records/)
* [OpenCorporate](https://opencorporates.com/)

## Notes

* Use multiple search engines as they may generate different results depending on when they crawled content and their algorithms. Besides Google and google hacking, try Bing and Baidu for example. 
* Both Duck Duck Go and ixquick (startpage) provide reduced information leakage about the tester.
