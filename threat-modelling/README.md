# Threat modelling

With a [systematic analysis](https://github.com/tymyrddin/orchard/wiki/Profiling-adversaries) of a probable attacker's profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker, defenders can focus on what is most important to protect. 

### Examples

(Hopefully) human-readable:
* [De-Anonymisation Threat Modelling](DA-threat-model), an example of using threat modelling with a quite non-trivial adversary, namely an entire eco-system of players and an often forgotten target, the individual citizen.
* [Search Engine Threat Modelling](SE-threat-model), an example of organising thoughts and connections for two targets, search engines and their users.

Contains unreadable techno-babble:
* [E2EE Threat Modelling](E2EE-threat-model)
