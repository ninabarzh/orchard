# Terraforming threat modelling

Bottom-up and top-down trailblazing with intent to create human-readable threat modelling examples. A work in progress.

Where you stand depends on where you sit, and all threats are cross-vector threats. Without a clear mandate for measuring and reporting actual improvements in security, attempts at improving security makes absolutely no sense, not even for the low-hanging fruit.  

* [De-Anonymisation threat modelling](DA-threat-model), an example of using attacker-based threat modelling with a quite non-trivial adversary, namely an entire eco-system of players and an often forgotten target, the individual citizen. (Attacker-centric)
* [Search Engine threat modelling](SE-threat-model), an example of organising thoughts and connections of two targets, search engines and their users. (Attacker-centric)
* [E2EE threat modelling](E2EE-threat-model) on that most E2EE systems are secure against only the weakest passive adversaries, yet breakable not by cryptanalysis of underlying cryptographic algorithms but by flawed system designs and security assumptions. (Attacker-centric)
* [Web application threat modelling](application-threat-model), the generalised-usual (software-centric)
