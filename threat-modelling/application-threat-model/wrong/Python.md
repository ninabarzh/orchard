* Although Python 3 has been out for more than a decade, and support for Python 2 ended January 1, 2020. Many production sites are still running Python 2.7 and are open to security vulnerabilities.

Colourama, when run on Windows servers, adds a script which monitors the serverâ€™s clipboard for signs that a user is about to make a cryptocurrency payment and if so, diverts the payments from the wallet address contained in the clipboard to an attacker-owned wallet.
