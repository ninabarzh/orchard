# DA Threat Modelling

De-anonymisation is a strategy in data mining in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other sources of data to re-identify the anonymous data source. Besides being used by those that do not have users' best interest in mind, de-anonymisation also works to further help improve anonymisation techniques and reduce privacy breach by probing the potential drawbacks of anonymisation techniques.

The below are the result of my notes made during a literature study of and some DIY datamining for known possible attack vectors, attacks, current and possible uses and effects, and if and where mentioned or possible, mitigations.
