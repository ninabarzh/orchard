# Vulnerable endpoints

An endpoint is a computing device that communicates back and forth with a network to which is it connected, like desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, servers, workstations, printers, and is not limited to physical devices, but includes, for example, browsers and web applications. They all represent key vulnerable points of entry for adversaries.

With people becoming more mobile and users connecting to internal resources (home or organisational intranets) from off-premise endpoints all over the world, endpoints are increasingly susceptible to being breached. Objectives for targeting endpoints include:

* Taking control of the device and using it in a botnet to execute a DoS attack.
* Using the endpoint as an entry point into an organisation to access high-value assets and information.
* Accessing assets on the endpoint to exfiltrate or hold hostage, for ransom or for disruption.

## Mitigation requirements

* Advanced endpoint security solutions need to be integrated and prevent known and unknown malware and exploits; 
* Automate as much as possible so as to not have people only working on known security issues and adhering to security policies; 
* Protect and enable users without impacting their performance (much).
