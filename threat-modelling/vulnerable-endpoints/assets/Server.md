# Server

Server security is as important as network security because servers often hold a great deal of vital information. It is considered the foundation the building rests on. If a server is compromised, all of its contents may become available for the adversary to steal or manipulate at will.

Regardless of server based protections and [TLS/SSL PKI based encryption](../../E2EE-threat-model/threats/TLSSSL-PKI-vulnerabilities.md), the majority of HTTPS servers are vulnerable to connection hijacking attacks and the most common attack is simply luring a person to run a shell on his own machine/host by using social engineering techniques, leading to further [phishing](../../../trees/social-engineering/Phishing.md), [pharming](../../../trees/social-engineering/Phishing.md) and [man-in-the-middle](../../../trees/social-engineering/Phishing.md) attacks.
