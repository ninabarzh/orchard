# Orchard

[Another Work in Progress]

A repository for getting started with pentesting/red teaming/colourful teaming:

* [Threat modelling](threat-modelling): bottom-up and top-down trailblazing with intent to create human-readable threat modelling examples.
* [Attack trees](trees): Puzzle pieces to jump start exploitation. The pieces may not belong in a specific context or for a particular puzzle. If so, we make new pieces and add those.
* [Resources](resources): Reuseful scripts and cheatsheets.
