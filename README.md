# Orchard

Another Work Forever In Progress because of aiming at moving targets, a repository for getting started with pentesting/red teaming/colourful teaming, deployed on [gitbook](https://tymyrddin.gitbook.io/orchard/) (so search is available).

* [Terraforming threat modelling](threat-modelling): bottom-up and top-down trailblazing with intent to create human-readable threat modelling examples.
* [Snapping us some dark matter](trees): Puzzle pieces (attack trees) to jump start exploitation. The pieces may not belong in a specific context or for a particular puzzle. If so, we make new pieces and add those.
* [Creating shelf space](resources): Reuseful scripts and cheatsheets. 
* [Munching galaxies](mitigations): Just a few notes on possible mitigations.
* The wiki contains [some generalised background/contextual notes](https://github.com/tymyrddin/orchard/wiki/).
