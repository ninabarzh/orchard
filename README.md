# Orchard

[Another Work in Progress]

A repository for getting started with pentesting/red teaming/colourful teaming:

* Threat modelling: With a systematic analysis of a probable attacker's profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker, defenders can focus on what is most important to protect. 
* Attack trees: Puzzle pieces to jump start exploitation. The pieces may not belong in a specific context or for a particular puzzle. If so, we make new pieces and add those.
* Resources: Reuseful scripts and cheatsheets.
