# E2EE messaging applications

Security goals:

* Confidentiality: Only the two participants of pair-wise messaging or legitimate group member of group messaging can see the message plaintext.
* Integrity: If a message is received and successfully validated, then it was indeed sent by the given sender, i.e., other users cannot plant messages into it and they can not modify it.

* Wire is an encrypted communications program created by Wire Swiss offering messaging, voice calling, and video calling, all end-to-end encrypted. It is cross-platform, and can be used on multiple devices.
