# Server

Server security is as important as network security because servers often hold a great deal of vital information. It is considered the foundation the building rests on. If a server is compromised, all of its contents may become available for the adversary to steal or manipulate at will.

# MitM server-to-server HTTPS communication

Some server-side HTTP client libraries accept untrusted TLS communication by default. The most common attack vectors for MitM-ing a server-to-server HTTPS communication that accepts untrusted SSL certificates are:

* [DNS cache poisoning](../../../trees/application-hacking/DNS-spoofing.md) can be used to replace the real endpoint with an attacker's replacement using a self-signed certificate.
* An adversary can rent a server in the same data center/from the same host, or compromise a vulnerable server on an intranet and attempt an [ARP spoofing](../../../trees/network-attacks/ARP-spoofing.md).
* [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijacking](../../../trees/network-attacks/Hijack-BGP.md): Once an adversary obtains access to a BGP peer, she can announce any prefix she wants to the other peers of the vulnerable ISP, causing denial of service or conducting a MitM attack for either the hijacked prefix or the upstream ISP itself in case the incoming traffic requires more bandwidth than that ISP can handle. Suppose a target server and visitors are in France, and the prefix is hijacked local to the US (adversary has chosen to get a certificate from a CA in the US). In that case it is possible to impersonate the target (because no reliable identification method is used by the CA for X.509 certificates) or impersonate a WHOIS server of her registrar and obtain a perfectly valid TLS/SSL certificate for the target domain. The procedure takes 15 minutes at most, and immediately after, she may stop announcing the target's prefix. The target will have only those 15 minutes to detect the issue. The certificate will be valid globally, so it may be used in man-in-the-middle attacks anywhere in the world.
    * For a basic TLS certificate, the Certificate Authority (CA) asks that applicants prove that they own the associated domain. While many approaches can be used to provide this proof, one of the most common is having the applicants post specific content at a URL on that domain. When a domain has been temporarily hijacked, the adversary can post the content and then be issued a domain-validated (DV) certificate within minutes.
    * Letâ€™s Encrypt makes the creation of SSL certificates free and easy.

The MitM server-to-server HTTPS communication vulnerabilitiy isn't about a vulnerability in a software, it is about a flawed concept. The abstraction of trusted Internet routing is wrong. The [listed mitigations](../../../mitigations/server/README.md) can help some, but are like mopping up the leaked water with the tap open, and only a few information security specialists and network engineers use them.
