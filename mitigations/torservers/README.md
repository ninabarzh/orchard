# Tor servers

The Tor network consists of volunteer operated servers that improve the privacy and security of data. A series of virtual tunnels are created between relays of the network, and for each data transmission a random relay path is chosen.

* [Entry/Guard](Entry-Guard-relays.md) relays are best set up on servers.
* In countries where Tor is blocked by governments and/or corporations, set up [bridge relays](Bridge-relay.md) instead of Entry/Guard relays.
* Running a [middle relay](Middle-relay.md) is most suitable for users who want to support the network and/or use Tor from a PC at home.
* Only run an [exit relay](Exit-relay.md) if you are ready to receive multiple complaints, legal notices, take down notices or DMCA notices.
