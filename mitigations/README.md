# Munching galaxies

As cosmic archaeologists, we are digging through the fossils of long-dead galaxies rather than human history, except that in our case humans still inhabit those galaxies.

These are near-galaxy mitigations (including and beyond the low-hanging fruit conditions or occurrences traceable to a cause) for ancient threats that can still be found in the internet universe. None of this is complete of course. None of it ever will be, but I think this is a decent start.

We also wish to explore beyond, going where we have not gone before, in particular for application and intranet and internet networking.
