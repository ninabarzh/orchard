# Mitigations

Where you stand depends on where you sit, and all threats are cross-vector threats. Without a clear mandate for measuring and reporting actual improvements in security, attempts at improving security makes absolutely no sense, not even for the low-hanging fruit. 

These are all fruity and common mitigations (including and beyond the low-hanging conditions or occurrences traceable to a cause) for threats that can still be found in the wild.
