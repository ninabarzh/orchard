# Munching galaxies

As cosmic archaeologists, we are digging through the fossils of long-dead galaxies rather than human history, except that in our case humans still inhabit those galaxies.

These are all near-galaxy mitigations (including and beyond the low-hanging fruit conditions or occurrences traceable to a cause) for ancient threats that can still be found in the internet universe. None of this is complete of course. None of it ever will be. There is still more, in particular for intranet and internet networking, but I think this is a decent start.
