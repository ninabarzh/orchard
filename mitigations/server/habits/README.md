# Healthy habits

  * Write protect configuration files. 
  * Restrict access to directories with proper permissions.
  * Do not do development on production systems.
  * Use root account only when required. Use sudo to grant others (sudo) root level access.
  * No job security. Document and comment in plain language.
  * Be lazy. Automate routine tasks to make time for keeping current, thinking, puzzling with configurations, security research, and exploring new tools. 
    * Automate backups
    * Centralise logging
    * Use a configuration management tool
