Minimally ...

* Stay updated with subscriptions to security notification services.
* Update the OS regularly (within hours of critical updates).
* Update the control panel regularly (if any).
* Reduce information disclosure.
* Donâ€™t install software that is not used. Remove software that is not used.
* Use private networks for internal server traffic.
* Use encryption when appropriate.
* Harden default service settings in webserver, SSH and other services.
* Disable direct root login in SSH.
* Get rid of passwords with SSH keys.
* Make sure logs are working properly.
* Make sure you log all information needed to track a common intruder.
* Consider intrusion detection.
* Enable SELinux if possible.

Note: In these notes commands preceded with `#` do not mean to do it as root, it means root privileges are required (`su -` or `sudo`). When `$` is used that most likely does not mean just any user. Often, services and applications have their own user.
