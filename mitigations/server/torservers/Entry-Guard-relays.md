# Entry/Guard relays

Entry/Guard relays are the entry point to the Tor network. A client that wants to connect to the Tor network will first connect to a guard node. Guard nodes can see the real IP address of the connecting client. The list of guard nodes is available in the public list of Tor nodes.
