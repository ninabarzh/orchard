# Web-applications

Unauthorised access to our data can occur due to a web application not properly protecting data. A lack of quality encryption and improper key generation is often cause. Luckily, this type of vulnerability is difficult to exploit.

* Strict data encryption with a proven encryption technique
* Protect websites with the [HTTPS (SSL/TLS) protocol](../protocols/Transport-Layer-Security-Secure-Sockets-Layer-(TLS-SSL).md)
* Weaknesses in password hashing algorithms can be used to steal sensitive information stored on a web or application server. Use cryptographic hash functions to implement password hashing.
* Use third-party pentesting. Even the best senior programmers are susceptible to making mistakes. Review the application for potential vulnerabilities. For best results, do it regularly.
