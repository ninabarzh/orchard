# Removing metadata from files

Metadata is data about data. An image may include metadata that describes how large the picture is, colour depth, resolution, when it was created, and other data. Text metadata may contain information about who the author is, when the document was written and how many times it was changed. Web pages often include metadata in the form of meta tags. Description and keywords meta tags are commonly used to describe the Web page's content. Most search engines use this data when adding pages to their search index.

And metadata can also be used for other, more shifty purposes:

* Metadata is collected by corporations for psychological manipulation in persuasion and advertising.
* Metadata also plays a number of important roles in [computer forensics](https://tymyrddin.wiki/forensics/start):
    * It can provide corroborating information about the document data itself.
    * It can reveal information that someone tried to hide, delete, or obscure.
    * It can be used to automatically correlate documents from different sources.
* Metadata is used by hackers doing [reconnaissance](https://github.com/tymyrddin/orchard/blob/main/trees/reconnaissance/README.md) for an attack
* And last but not least, it can be used to correlate data in dragnet and targeted [surveillance](https://www.tymyrddin.blog/tags/#surveillance).

Photos, and images in general, contain metadata you may not want out there. For photos this includes the GPS coordinates of the location they were taken at, the date and time, camera shutter setting details, and possibly even the name of the program you used to edit them. This type of metadata can be useful, but you may want to remove it from your photos before sharing them online.

Document metadata is information about one or more aspects of a document, spreadsheet, pdf file, that is not always visible to the person creating them, but can be found by the person who receives them next. Comments, track changes, hidden text, mark-ups, properties, attachments and bookmarks are all examples of document metadata. Metadata removal software identifies and removes the metadata contained within a document so it cannot be shared.

## Techniques for metadata removal

* Using the Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit (MAT)
* Using a hex editor
* Using vi as hex editor
* Using pdftk and sed to clean pdf files
* Edit exif metadata in images
