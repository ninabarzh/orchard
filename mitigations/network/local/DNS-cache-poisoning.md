# DNS cache poisoning

* Use Passive DNS databases for near-real-time detection of fraudulent delegation changes and cache poisoning. The databases can be queried frequently to know more about the addresses being mapped by the major domain names at the time. All the information will come directly from the passive Data sensors and in the case of any deviations from the regular mappings of data gathered from an authoritative source, it could mean a breach of web security. Passive DNS data is rich, and can also be used to help administrators block the resolution of suspicious new domain names, identify potential infringements and as source for threat intelligence.
