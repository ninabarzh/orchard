# Pentesting (BlackArch)

Download [BlackArch](https://www.blackarch.org/). I downloaded the iso's and the ova and tried them all.

Unpack:

    $ tar xvf blackarch-linux-2020.12.01.ova
    blackarch-linux-2020.12.01.ovf
    blackarch-linux-disk001.vmdk
    blackarch-linux-2020.12.01.mf

Convert:

    $ qemu-img convert -O qcow2 blackarch-linux-disk001.vmdk blackarch.qcow2

And that takes quite awhile.

Copy `blackarch.qcow2` to `/var/lib/libvirt/images` and use in `virt-manager` to import into a VM. Hangs, just like creating a new VM from the blackarch `.iso`.

Dependency failed for `/boot`, local file systems and a check on `/dev/sda` (doesn't exist, is called `vda`). TBH, there has been no new version since first quarter 2020, so is probably abandoned.
