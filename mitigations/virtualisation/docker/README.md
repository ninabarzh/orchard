# Docker

As a preparation for collaborative pentesting open source projects in production. First a [local server with docker tools](../kvm/Docker-tools.md), and saying hello three times. 

If all works, feel comfortable, and have the resources, a remote for a "Hello world" to set up a simple integration and penetration testing workflow of applications. I am considering Digital Ocean. If anybody knows a better place, let me know.
