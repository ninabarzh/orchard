# Server with docker

As a preparation for collaborative pentesting open source projects in production. First a server with docker tools locally (see [Qubes](../qubes/Docker-tools.md) and [KVM VM](../kvm/Docker-tools.md), both are centos 8), then if all works, feel comfortable, and have the resources, a remote for a "Hello world" to set up integration and penetration testing workflow of applications.

I am considering Digital Ocean. If anybody knows a better place, let me know.
