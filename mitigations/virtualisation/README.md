# Virtualisation

The new Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 9 kept giving blackscreen as soon as the stick was starting up, so not doable yet (tried everything but had to hard reset it with every attempt). Luckily the old Inspiron did give me the Install screen on boot, so (even though freezes and crashes) I can still try Qubes. The Thinkpad also did not accept debian yet, but did install Ubuntu.

The below choices also make sure I get a decent amount of exposure to Qubes, KVMand Docker and will feel comfortable using them when I am done (I will have gone to install H&%% and back).

- [ ] [Qubes (The plan)](qubes)
  - [ ] [Password manager](qubes/Password-manager.md)
  - [ ] [Traffic](qubes/Traffic.md)
  - [ ] [Communication]
  - [ ] [Development]
  - [ ] [CentOS server with docker]
  - [ ] [Pentesting]
  - [ ] [Digital forensics]
- [x] [Ubuntu with KVM](kvm) 
  - [x] VM for communication (debian)
  - [ ] VM for development (debian)
  - [ ] VM for pentesting (kali)
  - [ ] VM for server (CentOS)
  - [ ] Sandbox VM for Digital forensics
- [ ] [Docker](docker)
