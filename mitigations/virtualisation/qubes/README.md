# Qubes PC: The plan

The new Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 9 kept giving blackscreen as soon as the stick was starting up, so not doable yet (tried everything but had to hard reset it with every attempt). Luckily the old Inspiron did give me the Install screen on boot, so (even though freezes and crashes) I can still try Qubes.

These choices also make sure I get a decent amount of exposure to [Qubes ways](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/) and will feel comfortable with it when I am done (I will have gone to install H&%% and back).
