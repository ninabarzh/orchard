# Qubes PC: The plan

The new Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 9 kept giving blackscreen as soon as the stick was starting up, so not doable yet (tried everything but had to hard reset it with every attempt). The old Inspiron did give me the Install screen on boot, but failed during the test for the type of virtualisation technology required.

This will remain a plan until I can get me a BEAST. :)
