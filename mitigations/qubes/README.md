# Qubes PC: The plan

These choices also make sure I get a decent amount of exposure to [Qubes ways](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/) and will feel comfortable with it when I am done (I will have gone to install H&%% and back).

## Vault

- [ ] Keepassx

## Traffic

For normal VPN (development, server administration) and chained anonymous VPN -> Tor traffic (pentesting):

- [ ] Anonymise MAC address
- [ ] Install the Whonix Template
- [ ] Set up for disposable Whonix VM's
- [ ] Get two different VPN's (of which one anonymous)
- [ ] Set up for disposable VPN VM's

## Communication

Signal, Keybase and Thunderbird (separated)

- [ ] Create Debian 10 Template VM
- [ ] For each SW, Clone template VM, Install software in clone, Create AppVM.

## Development

- [ ] Clone a new debian Template VM
- [ ] Install all development tools I have been using in the template 
- [ ] Create Debian App VM's 
- [ ] AppVM for administrative repository ut7

## Pentesting

I know Kali, but wish to try BlackArch as possible alternative.

- [ ] Create a Kali Linux VM from a Debian template
- [ ] Create a minimal ArchLinux template
- [ ] Learn how to debug Qubes templates
- [ ] Install BlackArch on top of ArchLinux

## CentOS server

- [ ] Install the standard CentOS TemplateVM in dom0
- [ ] Install docker in the template
- [ ] Get and set up remote server (unmanaged VPS) with CentOS
- [ ] rsync docker

## Digital forensics

For starters sift-cli. More tools later.

- [ ] Use Qubes Builder to make an Ubuntu 16.04 Template VM
- [ ] Clone the Ubuntu Template VM
- [ ] Install SIFT-CLI
