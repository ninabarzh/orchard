# Broken authentication, poor session management

* Use [SSL](../protocols/Transport-Layer-Security-Secure-Sockets-Layer-(TLS-SSL).md)
* Encrypt credentials when stored on the server, using hashing, MD5, etc.
* Enforce strict cookie control, to thwart impersonating tokens.
* Proactively monitor for updates and patches to servers, scripts, software and applications.
