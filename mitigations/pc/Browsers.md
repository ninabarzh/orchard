# Browsers

Many of the [browser vulnerabilities](../../resources/vulnerabilities/endpoints/Browser.md) exploited by the attacks and abuses mentioned need to be fixed by the developers of browsers and web applications, which arenâ€™t much under the direct control of users, but users are not entirely powerless.

### Individuals

* View the metadata browsers are sending
* Check extensions/add-ons/plugins for known vulnerabilities
* Change default browser settings to exclude cookies, since they can be used to build up detailed profiles of surfing patterns over time.
* Use private browsing.
* Use safer browsing.
* Use networked or single-point anonymisers to obscure identifying information.
* Security awareness training
* Lock down the browser and the software it can invoke.
* Tighten associated application settings to disable unwanted features and to configure trust zones.

### Organisations

* Organisations best tighten application settings to disable unwanted features and configure trust zones centrally (using the Group Policy feature of Active Directory?)

### Developers

* Frame busting is a severely limited protection from clickjacking. For example, frame-busting JavaScript can be defeated by disabling JavaScript. Some clickjacking looks for CSRF vulnerabilities by looking for evidence of exclusively cookie based session ids, using a variety of heuristics to identify and verify whether various parameters are serving as session tokens. Combinations of lack of frame busting and/or CSRF issues can lead to opening up for clickjacking for pages requiring an authenticated session.
* Use persistent and transient authentication methods (or a hidden field provided on every form) to aid protection against CSRF
* Sandbox applications so that adversaries will need to use two exploits: one for the vulnerable browser or add-on/extension and another to break out of the sandbox.
