# Browsers

Many of the [browser vulnerabilities](../../resources/vulnerabilities/endpoints/Browser.md) exploited by the attacks and abuses mentioned need to be fixed by the [developers of browsers and web applications](../../application), which arenâ€™t much under the direct control of users, but users are not entirely powerless.

* View the metadata browsers are sending
* Check extensions/add-ons/plugins for known vulnerabilities
* Change default browser settings to exclude [cookies](../../data/browsing/Cookies.md) and [FLoC](../../data/browsing/FLoC.md), since they can be used to build up detailed profiles of surfing patterns over time.
* Use [private browsing](../data/browsing/Private-browsing.md).
* Use the rest of [safer browsing](../data/browsing) also.
* Use [networked or single-point anonymisers][../data/traffic] to obscure identifying information.
* Security awareness training
* Lock down the browser and the software it can invoke.
* Tighten associated application settings to disable unwanted features and to configure trust zones.
