# Types of pentesting

## Black box

In black box penetration testing we are interested in gathering information about the target network or system. We only know expected outcomes (system specifications and claims) and do not examine any code. Testers do not need to be coders themselves (specific language knowledge is not needed). We usually take the perspective of a user. These kinds of tests are difficult to design and do not cover everything. As a result they may not be worth it.

## White box

White box testing can be very comprehensive (and susceptible to scope creep). A lot of information about the systems and/or network are available (Schema, Source code, OS details, IP addresses, etc). It is more like a simulation of an attack. It can involve data flow testing, path testing, loop testing, etc. to test all independent paths of a module have been exercised, all logical decisions have been verified along with their true and false values, check for typographical errors, and reveal design errors (differences between logical flows and actual execution).

## Grey box

In grey box testing some information about the internal details of the program of a system are available. It can be seen as an attack by an external hacker who had gained illegitimate access to an organisation's network infrastructure documents. The test is reasonably non-intrusive and unbiased (as the tester has no access to source code). There is a risk at conflicts between developers and test team, because those are often separated.

## Red teaming

Red teaming is a full-scope, multi-layered attack simulation designed to measure how well a company's people and networks, applications and physical security controls can withstand an attack from a real-life adversary. It runs for an extended period of time, e.g., multiple weeks or months of emulating the same attacker. With enough time and resources, all security defences will fall. Red teaming is not meant to score the skill of defenders – but the cost to adversaries. Blue teaming is meant to increase the cost to adversaries. Purple teaming integrates the defensive tactics and controls from blue teams with the threats and vulnerabilities found by red teams into a single narrative that maximizes both while minimising the inconvenience for operations adding these defensive tactics and controls.

## Colourful teaming

I agree with [Miessler](https://danielmiessler.com/study/red-blue-purple-teams/). I don’t much care for the word “team” being assigned to the colours, as I too think in most cases they’re actually mindsets, or functions, rather than dedicated groups of people. And we can build on red teaming by, for example:
* having flexible teams with people in more than one role (like the bees and butterflies in open space meetings)
* in the case of a coalition of organisations, adding coordinators from the various organisations (to add forgotten strengths and making sharing of results that may  be re-useful in other contexts easier). That can also be used to build coalitions.
* Inviting people from a targeted risk group, for increasing operational awareness for defending a (digital) environment.
