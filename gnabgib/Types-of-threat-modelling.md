# Types of threat modelling

There will always be activities that defenders can do to spot weaknesses before adversaries do. Threat modelling for example. 
Threat modelling comes in different flavours:

* Adversary-centric: Studying the history and past interactions of adversaries showing what they may take as their next move.
* Quick and dirty: Prioritising potential threats from a hypothetical attacker's point of view for finding the low hanging fruit.
* Asset-centric: Using trees and graphs for visually illustrating patterns and vulnerabilities by which an asset can be attacked.
* Software-centric: Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat (VAST) modelling for scaling threat modelling processes associated with applications.

Though pigeonholed into these stances, and though many assistive tools exist, the best results come from using all and none of them, using common sense, and including experienced other perspectives in a particular context. 

It's systematic, and like most penetration testing, a choreography that benefits from diversity (in thinking), because it all depends: On who the adversaries are, on the context, on what information needs protecting, on the assets (networks, software, data and information systems, development environments), on what is considered in scope and what not, and on the people using the system (i.e. the individuals working with the definition, implementation and maintenance of security policies), and whether lives depend on it or not.
