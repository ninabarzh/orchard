# Data

Data can be categorised as public data or private/protected data. All of us, individuals, organisations, governments, have confidential data that must be safeguarded from appearing in the public domain.

## Web applications

Unauthorised access to our data can occur due to a web application not properly protecting data. A lack of quality encryption and improper key generation is often cause. Luckily, this type of vulnerability is difficult to exploit.

## Data science

Privacy seems to have become a data management problem with a business process wrapped around it, culminating data governance strategies for organisations and governments, legalised by new laws such as the GDPR. The information gathered can be used for [deanonymisation](../../../threat-modelling/DA-threat-model).
