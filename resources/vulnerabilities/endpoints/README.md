# Vulnerable endpoints

Humans, flawed concepts, and vulnerable end-points are the foundation the building rests on. This is very much a work in progress ...

The vast majority of Internet users don’t have security backgrounds. Organisations and companies do not care much about information security and the possible severity of any attack that could harm valuable assets. Some policies may exist, mostly for the form of it because they are not enforced and employees are not given security awareness training. If and when, security experts and pen-testers focus on client-server exploits. Devices are made with the next best-selling feature in mind, not users' privacy and security. As a result, humans and vulnerable end-points are the weakest link in the information security chain.

With people becoming more mobile and users connecting to internal resources (home or organisational intranets) from off-premise endpoints all over the world, endpoints are increasingly susceptible to being breached. Objectives for targeting endpoints include (but are not limited to):

* Taking control of the device and using it in a botnet to execute a DoS attack.
* Using the endpoint as an entry point into an organisation to access high-value assets and information.
* Accessing assets on the endpoint to exfiltrate or hold hostage, for ransom or for disruption.

## Mitigation requirements

* Advanced endpoint security solutions need to be integrated and prevent known and unknown malware and exploits; 
* Automate as much as possible so as to not have people only working on known security issues and adhering to security policies; 
* Protect and enable users without impacting their performance (much). 
Mitigation requirements
* To prevent security breaches, a shift must occur – from detecting and responding to incidents in hindsight, to preventing security breaches from occurring in the first place.
* Where possible, endpoint security needs to be baked into hardware services from the start to avoid breaches.
* Endpoints must be protected from known, unknown and zero-day threats delivered through malware and exploits independent of whether a machine is online or offline, on-premise or off-premise, connected to an organisation's network or not.
* Threat data must continuously be gathered from within the organisation – from the network, storage solutions and endpoints.
* Protection against exploits for all applications, including third-party and proprietary applications, especially when applications enhance security.
* A fast check/test/validation/risk analysis/approval process for new applications.
* Endpoint protection must be lightweight enough not to require significant system resources
* The best endpoint security solutions support unpatchable systems by preventing the exploitation of software vulnerabilities, known or unknown, regardless of the availability or application of security patches
* Scale (to as many endpoints as needed), be flexible (in its ability to provide protection while not overly restricting), and be manageable enough for deployment
