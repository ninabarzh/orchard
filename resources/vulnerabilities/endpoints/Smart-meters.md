# Smart meters

Smart Meters are yet another possible surveillance device. They are a search without a warrant. They collect detailed energy usage, for instance: when you cook, watch TV, whether you are home or not, when you turn on a light, or if you have guests. This data is very valuable because it can reveal patterns about what you do and when for [behavioural profiling](../../DA-threat-model/assistive-technologies/Behavioural-analysis.md).

A list of potential privacy consequences of Smart Grid systems include:

* Identity Theft
* Determine Personal Behaviour Patterns
* Determine Specific Appliances Used
* Perform Real-Time Surveillance
* Reveal Activities Through Residual Data
* Targeted Home Invasions (latch key children, elderly, etc.)
* Provide Accidental Invasions
* Activity Censorship
* Decisions and Actions Based Upon Inaccurate Data
* Profiling
* Unwanted Publicity and Embarrassment
* Tracking Behaviour Of Renters/Leasers
* Behaviour Tracking (possible combination with Personal Behaviour Patterns)
* Public Aggregated Searches Revealing Individual Behaviour
