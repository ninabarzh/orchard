# Gathering public information

## Tools

### Search engines
* Google
* Duckduckgo
* Ixquick (Startpage)
* Binsearch
* Shodan

* Use multiple search engines as they may generate different results depending on when they crawled content and their algorithms. Besides Google and google hacking, try Bing and Baidu for example. 
* Both Duck Duck Go and ixquick (startpage) provide reduced information leakage about the tester.
