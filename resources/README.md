# Resources

I do not like the checklist approach, I want to understand how technologies works, not just follow some linearised process (which is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole anyhow). Hence the resources also contain links to protocol headers and other resources aiding in understanding how technologies work so that I can reason about security more effectively.
