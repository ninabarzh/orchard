# Resources

I am not a big fan of the checklist approach (though it can be handy when purpose of the pentesting is to prove compliance to a set of rules). I prefer to understand how technologies work, instead of following some linearised process (which is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole anyhow). 

The resources also contain (links to) other resources for understanding how technologies work, aiding actual reasoning about security.
