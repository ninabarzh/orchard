# Creating shelf space

Gathering some possibly (re)useful resources online. If the web comes crashing down, we don't want these in our real libraries anyway.

We are not big fans of checklist approaches (though such can be handy when purpose of pentesting is to (dis)prove compliance to a set of rules). We prefer to understand how technologies work, instead of following some linearised process (which is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole anyhow). 

The resources also contain (links to) other resources for understanding how technologies work, aiding actual reasoning about security.
