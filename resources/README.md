# Resources

I am not a big fan of the checklist approach (though it can be handy at times depending on purpose of the pentesting which may be just to comply to a set of rules). I prefer to understand how technologies work, instead of following some linearised process (which is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole anyhow). 

The resources also contain other resources for understanding how technologies work, aiding reasoning about security more effectively.
